      - text: "Anti-virus protection can be added to Cloud Foundry via the BOSH Add-on feature. \  
      \ ClamAV is a widely used open source solution for anti-virus protection.  A ClamAV \ 
      \ Add-on release is available, or customers may also deploy another anti-virus solution packaged \
      \ as a BOSH Add-on. Using this Add-on feature, operators can ensure that the anti-virus agent is \
      \ installed on all target VMs across the Cloud foundry deployment."

      - key: b
      - text: "ClamAV configuration is controlled via the runtime-configuration.yml deployment manifest, \
      \ and the ClamAV configuration file.  Periodic and/or on-demand scanning may be verified by \
      \ inspecting these files." 
      - key: c
      - text: "The ClamAV anti-virus signatures are kept up to date via the fleshclam daemon, which is \
      \ installed as part of the add-on release. Logs providing evidence of anti-virus scan activity \
      \ are emitted to syslog. "
      - key: d
      - text: "All ClamAV add-on logs are written to the configured syslog drain.  The proper retention \
      \ and lifecycle management of these logs is then the responsibility of the operators."

       - text: "BOSH and monit ensure that any deployed jobs, including ClamAV anti-virus, \
       \ remain healthy. If for some reason the ClamAV anti-virus job is not actively running, \
       \ BOSH will detect and correct the condition." 
       - key: b
       - text: "As described above, BOSH is responsible for maintaining the inventory of active jobs \
       \ in a deployment.  End users have no capability to disable or alter the anti-virus software."
       - key: c
       - text: "Configuration of which VMs within the Cloud Foundry deployment will run the ClamAV \
       \ anti-virus agent is determined by the BOSH Add-on runtime configuration manifest.  Changing \
       \ which virtual machines are running anti-virus protection requires a BOSH operator to update \
       \ the runtime configuration deployment manifest, and then perform a redeployment operation. "
