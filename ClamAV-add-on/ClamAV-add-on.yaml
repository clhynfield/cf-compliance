    narrative:
      Anti-virus protection can be added to Cloud Foundry via the BOSH Add-on feature.  A ClamAV 
      Add-on release is available, or customers may also deploy another anti-virus solution packaged
      as a BOSH Add-on. Using the Add-on feature, operators can ensure that the anti-virus agent is 
      installed on all target VMs across the Cloud foundry deployment.
